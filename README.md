# nbds_colab
> Literate programming for data science using nbdev, Jupytemplate and Google Colaboratory


nbds_colab is a template repository for small to medium sized data science projects which use the nbdev programming system from within Google Colaboratory. It combines the best features of the following to give quick project start-up followed by a complete low friction workflow, from first code to package release:

* Fastai.nbdev - exploratory programming, automated documentation generation, integrated testing and easy PyPi package release [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev//) 

* Google Colaboratory & Drive - low cost cloud computing with acceleration [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)

* Jupytemplate - standardized notebooks for data science [xstreamsrl Jupytemplate](https://github.com/xtreamsrl/jupytemplate)

* Full GitHub integration


## Getting started

Log in to your GitHub account (required for GitHub templates to work) then click [nbds_colab_template](https://github.com/hallmx/nbds_colab_template/generate) to create a new repository from this template. Enter a name for your project and click 'Create repository from template'. A new repo based on the template will be created in your GitHUb.
